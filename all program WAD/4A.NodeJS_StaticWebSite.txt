4A.Create a Node.JS Application which serves a static website. 


Node.js is an asynchronous event-driven JavaScript runtime built on Chrome’s V8 JavaScript engine. With Node, you can build all types of applications from desktop to web. Let’s build a Static Website with Node JS Webserver

Softwares used
Node.js
NPM
Express
VS Code
Node comes with NPM, which is package manager for JavaScript. NPM allows the discovery and usage of common packages functionality.

As mentioned above, for demonstration purpose we will use the Express framework. Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications.

app.js

const express = require('express');
const app = express()

app.get('/', function (req, res) {
    res.sendFile(__dirname + "/index.html")
});
app.listen(9000, function () {
    console.log("server creeated om port 9000");
})

index.html

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">

<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>Home</title>
</head>

<body>
    <h1>This is static page</h1>

</body>

</html>


Starting the Node JS Webserver:
