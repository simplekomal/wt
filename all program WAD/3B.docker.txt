3B.Problem Statement: Create Docker Container Environment (NVIDEIA Docker or any other).

Docker:Docker is a open platform which is used for shipping and running applications and it provides the ability to run an application in a loosely isolated environment
and the environtment is nothing but a containner.Because of this isolation and security,we can run many containners simultaneously on a given host
In Short :if you as developer ,developed a software that you can share this with other developer or tester,which can test this with docker img id ,remove the bugs and then forward for customer.

** Steps to implement this assignment:
 - Basic Requirements:

  1. Install Docker for Desktop/ Docker Toolbox as per your system support from below link. 
    Docker Desktop (For Windows 10+ 64-bit) Download Link : https://dockr.ly/38BQNLT
    Docker Toolbox (For Windows 7 or earlier 32-bit) Download Link : https://bit.ly/3lwZxpc

  2. Install Nodejs from below link.

  3. Add docker (from microsoft) extension in VS Code.

   4.Install Docker from the left extention icon on VS Code editor

 -Steps to Implement the Assignment:

  Step-1: Create a folder (Note: Folder name should be in lowercase).  
  Let the folder name be: demo

  Step-2: Create any file with any extension( such as .js, .txt, .py, etc....) in the same above folder(Here, docker_demo) and write some content in the file. 
  Let the file name be: komal.js

  The file contains the following code:
  console.log("Name:Komal");
  console.log("Designation: Assistant Professor");
  console.log("Subject: Web Technolgy");
  

  Step-3: Create file in the same folder with file name as- Dockerfile and press enter key. (Note: Don't add any file extension after the file name)
  File: Dockerfile 
   
  Step-4: Write following code in Dockerfile (Created in Step-3) and save it.:
  FROM node: alpine
  COPY . /demo
  CMD node /demo/komal.js

  Step-5: Open terminal in VS Code and type the following command:
  docker --version

  We will see the version of your docker if it is installed successfully. 

  Step-6: In the same terminal in VS Code, type the following command:
  node jyoti.js

  It will display the contents in your file which is created in Step-2.

  Step-7: In the same terminal in VS Code, type the following command: docker build -t demo . 
   We will see that it is successfully built. 

  Step-8: In the same terminal in VS Code, type the following command: docker images
  You will see the docker images with REPOSITORY, TAG, IMAGE ID, CREATED (Time), SIZE.
 step 9: docker run foldername
